# Adaptation Atlas Notebooks

This repository contains the code for the Africa Agriculture Adaptation Atlas notebooks, along with templates, documentation, and other resources to build new notebooks. The Adaptation Atlas notebooks are written in Quarto using Observable JavaScript. The current generation of notebooks can be accessed from the [Adaptation Atlas Website](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org/)

## About the Adaptation Atlas Project

The Africa Agriculture Adaptation Atlas is a aimed at strengthening adaptation programming across Africa using data driven decision-making. We aim to create scientifically robust data rich insights to inform decision-making and facilitate the development of effective adaptation programs, policies, and investments. These notebooks are the core of the Africa Agriculture Adaptation Atlas project and are designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and open. We adopt a story-based aproach to the notebooks with the aim of giving users direct and specific insights for their needs as quickly and easily as possible. This project is lead by the [Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT](https://alliancebioversityciat.org/) and is build in collaboration with a consortium of CGIAR centers, the Better Planet Laboratory at University of Colorado, Boulder and many other institutions, programs, and individuals. 

Please see our [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to set-up or contribute to the project.
