# KE-ENSO explorer — issues backlog

**For:** Claude Code / the developer, taking direction from Pete (sole owner of this branch).
**Scope:** open items on the KE-ENSO notebook + its KNBS-NAPR data pipeline. Settled decisions live
in `DECISIONS.md`; chronological work records in `dispatches/`; page-by-page data provenance in
`../../../data/KE-enso-explorer/_sources/napr_audit_ledger.csv`.

Each issue: `id · title · status · detail`. Status: `OPEN` / `HELD` (blocked with cause) / `DONE`.

## Data — KNBS NAPR (comprehensively mined; residual items only)

- **KE-01 · 2026 NAPR refresh · OPEN (future).** When KNBS releases the 2026 edition, run the
  `extract-knbs-napr` skill: add the PDF path + new year to the `Y*` lists in `napr_build.py`,
  `/…napr_audit.py` to re-inventory, shift page numbers, rebuild, check the validation report. Mostly
  mechanical — the report structure mirrors 2025.

- **KE-02 · Held tables (no data lost) · HELD.** Macadamia-2024 and Sesame-2024 fail the gate
  (Murang'a apostrophe-wrap 72%; 2021 double-count 104.9%) but are **superseded by their 2025-edition
  tables**, which are served — so no data is lost. Barley is served via manual-verify (D5). All
  recorded in the audit ledger.

- **KE-03 · Food-crop per-county VALUE — not in source · HELD (won't-fix).** The Section-3
  "Production and Value" body tables are area+prod only (subset of the annexes); per-county value is
  NOT in the PDF (value is national, in the prose). Confirmed by exact match of body vs annex. Nothing
  to extract.

- **KE-04 · Bixa is area-only · OPEN (minor).** Bixa has no production/value in the report (area in
  acres only, converted to ha). It's in the parquet but won't chart in the production/value figure.
  Fine; noted for awareness.

- **KE-07 · IWMI ENSO Outlook API · CLOSED (not worth building).** Live
  public API (`https://enso.iwmi.org/ENSO_api/api/v1`, 34 layers) scanned 2026-07-22 — see
  `dispatches/2026-07-22_iwmi-enso-api-scan.md`. Highest value: ECMWF SEAS5 / IRI NMME per-county
  seasonal rainfall FORECAST — the one thing the notebook lacks (Block 5 currently just links out).
  Also FAO ASIS + SPI/dry-spell for the ASAL drought story. Caveat: verify per-endpoint granularity
  (some "point" endpoints return a country mean); pull via the Python pipeline -> parquet, not live.

## Notebook

- **KE-05 · Produce filter for 30+ commodities · DONE.** Item filter defaults to the county's top-8
  by latest-year value; every item stays tickable. Revisit only if Pete wants grouping/search.

- **KE-06 · Sticky control bar overlaps the sources panel top when scrolled · OPEN (cosmetic).** The
  `<details>` "methodology & per-table sources" panel's first lines can sit behind the sticky
  county/season controls mid-scroll. Pre-existing sticky-header behaviour; low priority.

## Standing gaps (from the v1 handover — still true, NOT NAPR)

- County crop series is now **2019–2024** (was 2020–24) but Block 3 still uses **national FAOStat**
  (short county series). Revisit when enough county years exist for a county-level teleconnection.
- GESI county column: 47-way consensus gates the Kenya benchmark, not yet dual-engine on the county
  value. Don't count GESI as fully LLM-independent-gated.
- Climate-conflict signal is exploratory (small n) — never a headline figure.

## Recently closed (2026-07-15 → 22)

Robust deterministic NAPR engine + full mine of both editions: **31 crops** (2019–24, value×9),
**13 livestock species** (2021–23), **11 products** (2021–22). Produce figure gained a Products view
+ methodology/citations panel. Final full-PDF sweep = zero unaccounted pages. See dispatch addenda
6–14 and `DECISIONS.md`.
