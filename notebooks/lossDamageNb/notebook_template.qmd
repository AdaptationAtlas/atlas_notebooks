Agriculture supports the livelihoods of over 2.5 billion people, mostly in
low-income developing countries. Food production is largely dependent on
weather, and the variability of heat and rain in the growing season can lead to
high yields or conversely, damaged plants and poor harvests. Agriculture,
relative to other industries, bears a disproportionate
[63% share of loss and damage](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/30c0d98d-1c21-48ef-b5d9-8d988e6fa6f2/content)
from disasters such as drought, flooding, pest and disease.
[These losses, between 2008-2018, represent 108.5B USD lost due to declines in crop and livestock production in LMICs following disasters, with over 30B lost in Africa alone](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/30c0d98d-1c21-48ef-b5d9-8d988e6fa6f2/content).
Of these disasters, drought and floods represent the largest source of
agricultural losses at
[34% and 19% respectively](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/30c0d98d-1c21-48ef-b5d9-8d988e6fa6f2/content).

Farmers are not often well equipped to deal with these losses and it can
represent a significant source of economic hardship, particularly in the global
south where crop insurance and farmer assistance programs are lacking. Given the
variability in weather and affected farms, it is also not always abundantly
clear which farms are most impacted and where. The scale of the systems required
for making these payouts is poorly understood, but critical for implementation
down the road. This includes improvements in payment systems and recovery
supports needed as well better forecasting the size of programs needed for
adaptation and risk reduction, given future climate scenarios.

In this notebook we estimate the number of farms that will likely face losses or
lost revenue due to extreme events as well as what states/provinces in African
countries will be most impacted, using farm size distributions and historical
and future extreme event occurence. We also estimate the average number of farms
that will need paying out, numbers that are crucial for the development of
programs and policies to address these challenges and inequities.

# `{ojs} heading2` {#example-heading2}

Agriculture is a key industry in Africa, where
[50% of the region's workforce](https://www.fao.org/4/i2490e/i2490e01b.pdf)
engages in farming and it accounts for
[15% of the continent's GDP](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/b33cbb8d-eb27-487c-acab-6e7a705b3ac9/content).
Smallholders, small-scale farmers that manage areas varying from less than 1
hectare to 20 hectares, make up the majority of Africa's farms and provide
[up to 80%](https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/nr/sustainability_pathways/docs/Factsheet_SMALLHOLDERS.pdf)
of the food supply to the continent. The number of farms by farm class size
differ by countries across Africa, and there are expected shifts in the
distribution by 2050. Here you can explore the number of farms by farm class
size across the countries and sub-national regions in Africa and how they are
predicted to change by 2050.

# `{ojs} heading3` {#example-heading3}

As shown there is largely variability in the number of farms and farm size
across the African continent. Farms are differently affected by natural hazards
such as drought and floods, some of which can be attributed to the size of the
farm. The predicted probability of loss and predicted probability of lost
revenue, we show, is related to farm size as well as the type of hazard. Using
the dropdowns you can explore these relationships between farm size and loss or
lost revenue by type of hazard.

# `{ojs} heading4` {#example-heading4}

To estimate the potential loss and lost revenue by farm size both historically
and in the future for African farms, we need to determine the occurrence and
frequency of extreme events. To determine these events we use the Standardized
Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which is an multi-scalar drought
index which can be used to determine very dry and very wet conditions. *match to

(CMPI6) which have been
[identified](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40808-025-02560-3#Sec5)
as having high performance for simulating climate in Africa were used to develop
an ensemble average for the historical period (1995-2014) as well as two
[future scenarios](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/)
(2040-2060): SPP245, a middle of the road emissions scenario and SSP585, a high
emissions scenario. We show the ensemble means, which we use to estimate loss
and lost revenue in the next section, are remarkably conservative compared to
the CMIP6 model outputs for both very wet and very dry conditions.

# `{ojs} heading5` {#example-heading5}

As we have outlined above, agriculture in critical to Africa and there is
diversity in terms of the number of farms by farm size class across the country.
Extreme weather such as droughts and floods, which are exacerbated by climate
change as we show above, can cause losses on farms which in turn results in lost
revenue, and both of these vary by farm size class. Below the map illusrates the
average number of farms that experience extreme events (very wet or very dry)
over the time period. We can also explore the number of farms that have likely
been affected by losses due to extreme events such as very dry and very wet
conditions in our baseline period (1995-2014) and could be potentially be
impacted under future climate scenarios (SSP245 or SSP585). Furthermore, you can
also explore the amount of revenue that could potentially be lost on these farms
under either the baseline period or future climate scenarios for very dry and
very wet events without additional adaptation.

# `{ojs} nbSummary` {#summary}

Climate change will significantly impact farms, their productivity and farmer's
livelihoods on the African continent. This will have weighty implications for
food security, economic development, human health, and vulnerable rural
communities. Disaster events are worsening and the impact of climate
change-driven extreme events such as droughts and floods depend not only on the
climate scenarios, such as forcing and warming under SSP245 or SSP585, but also
on different farm size classes. Overall, although losses worsen for both very
dry and very wet conditions for larger farm sizes, the proportion of revenue
lost is highest for the smallest farms who usually have the least ability to
weather such economic shocks. Looking to the future, we see that the incidence
of loss and damage to farms in Africa is expected to increase with higher
probabilities of extreme events and a greater number of farms. There are a
number of solutions that have been proposed to address this challenge of
increasing climate-change driven losses on farms, including improved farmer
assistance programs, broadening crop insurance programs and their payouts,
expanding irrigation infrastructure and through improved seeds and training.
Multi-party funds meant to directly address loss and damage through adaptation
programs.

# Methods

## Farm size projections

We integrate spatial, demographic, and agricultural datasets to generate
harmonized projections of African farm size distributions from 2000 to 2060.
Spatial farm structure data from the CIAT/LUGE Smallholder Map were combined
with demographic projections from SSP2T and validated against the FAO World
Census of Agriculture, alongside auxiliary sources such as Ricciardi et al.
(2018) and Aliber & Hart (2009). For each country and administrative unit,
representative farm sizes were sampled from uniform or log-normal distributions
by size class, weighted by farm counts, and corrected via a mean-shift algorithm
to align with projected agricultural area totals. Corrected samples were
rebinned into standardized size categories and adjusted according to one of
three data availability cases—full data (spatial + demographic),
demographic-only, or spatial-only—using proportional scaling, continental
averages, or Ethiopia-based growth factors, respectively. Missing values were
filled using country or continental means, and all outputs were validated to
ensure consistency with farm totals, agricultural area, and realistic
distributional shapes. The resulting harmonized dataset provides subnational
farm size distributions for all African countries at decadal intervals
through 2060.

## Loss and proportion of lost reveneue probabilities

We examine how agricultural production losses from climate shocks (droughts and
floods) vary as a function of farm size using harmonized household survey data
from 17 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The study employs a
dataset developed by Mehrabi, Fortin, and Ramankutty, which integrates
household-level farm size, reported production losses, and corresponding
climatic indicators (SPEI). Data preparation included country-specific scaling
and outlier corrections to harmonize farm size distributions and
log-transformations to address skewness. Two main model types were implemented:
(1) binary loss models estimating the probability of experiencing a
climate-induced production loss, and (2) continuous loss models quantifying the
percentage of revenue lost. Both models incorporated interactions between
log-transformed farm size and event type (drought or flood) and used multilevel
random effects structures to account for nested spatial hierarchies (country and
administrative units). Models were further filtered for high SPEI thresholds (<
–0.99 for drought, > 0.99 for flood) to isolate the effects of severe climatic
events. Diagnostic checks, including residual simulation and bootstrapping, were
used to validate model assumptions, ensuring robust inference on the
relationship between farm size and vulnerability to climate shocks.

## Historical and CMIP6 estimates of loss by farm type

We estimate the number of extreme climate events and their impacts on African
farms by integrating climate, disaster, and agricultural datasets. Annual
growing-season extremes of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
Index (SPEI) were computed at the subnational level across Africa for the
historical period (1995–2015) and for future projections (2040–2060) under
SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, using ensemble means derived from five CMIP6 global
climate models (GFDL-ESM4, EC-Earth3, MPI-ESM1-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM).
Extreme events were defined as years when SPEI values exceeded ±1, corresponding
to very wet or very dry conditions. These modeled events were validated against
the EM-DAT disaster database to confirm that the SPEI-based approach captured
the timing and spatial distribution of major historical droughts and floods.
Once validated, the frequency of extreme events was used in combination with the
above empirically derived loss functions and 2020-2050 farm projections linking
farm size to production and revenue losses. For each administrative unit and
farm size class, the probability of farms experiencing loss was estimated for
each year and climate scenario, and corresponding revenue losses were calculated
as proportional reductions in farm income. The outputs include both yearly
averages and cumulative totals of farms and % of revenue affected, allowing
comparison of historical and future exposure to extreme climate events across
Africa.
