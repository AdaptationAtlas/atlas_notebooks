# Demo Notebooks

These notebooks are example ports from the original Atlas [notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@adaptationatlas). These may be useful for reference, but are not actively maintained or updated. 
They may also be useful as examples for how to create your own quarto notebooks. However, they may use old datasets, functions that are no longer applicable, and old code standards.

- [Discover Solutions](/notebooks/solutionsNB/DiscoverSolutions.qmd)

# Notebook Template
We provide a basic notebook template which can be copied and modified to assist in the development of new notebooks.
This template creates the basic structure for the notebooks as well as loads in some of the useful 
libraries and shared data (such as the admin boundaries).

**Find the template [here](/notebooks/nb_template/notebook_template.qmd)**
