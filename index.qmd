This page will often not be used directly in production. We have the [landing page](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org) for that.

# Notebook Template
We provide a basic notebook template which can be copied and modified to assist in the development of new notebooks.
This template creates the basic structure for the notebooks as well as loads in some of the useful 
libraries and shared data (such as the admin boundaries).

**Find the template [here](/notebooks/nb_template/notebook_template.qmd)**
