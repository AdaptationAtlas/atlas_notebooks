title: "Adaptation Atlas Notebooks"
---

This page will likely note be public facing in production. We have the [landing page](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org) for that.
However, this index page is useful in development to bounce between the examples, different notebooks being worked on, etc. 

# Notebook Template
We provide a basic notebook template which can be copied and modified to assist in the development of new notebooks.
This template creates the basic structure for the notebooks as well as loads in some of the useful 
libraries and shared data (such as the admin boundaries).

**Find the template [here](/notebooks/nb_template/notebook_template.qmd)**
