title: "Adaptation Atlas Notebooks"
---

This page will likely note be public facing in production. We have the
[landing page](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org) for that. However, this index
page is useful in development to bounce between the examples, different
notebooks being worked on, etc.

# Notebook Template

We provide a basic notebook template which can be copied and modified to assist
in the development of new notebooks. This template creates the basic structure
for the notebooks as well as loads in some of the useful libraries and shared
data (such as the admin boundaries).

**Find the template [here](/notebooks/gender/notebook.qmd)**
